## What is a Biochemistry Analyzer

The tedious part about getting human blood or other body fluid samples for testing is the actual analysis of each sample to test for anomalies. Traditionally, these tests were done manually by a human technologist who carefully examined each sample for results. Over time, however, it became apparent that the task takes too much time and effort, not allowing more than a few samples to be tested and analyzed every day. That is where the Biochemistry Analyzer intervine.


Also Known as a Full Automated Benchtop Clinical Blood Chemistry Biochemistry Analyzer, CCL 21, is a equipement used to measure the concentration of certain proteins, enzymes, electrolytes, metabolites, or even drugs in the provided samples of urine, blood, serum, plasma, or other body fluids. The machine consists of a tray where the samples are loaded to be tested.
